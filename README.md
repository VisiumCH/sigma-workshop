# Agentic Fighters

## Intro

Let's try to create an agentic architecture to generate a fight, having the generation of the fight made by an LLM!

To execute the *Agentic_fighters*, you can do it in 2 ways:

- run the src/main.py file from the root directory
- move the Exercise 5 notebook to the root directory, and run it

## What are agents?

An agent is a system that perceives its environment, makes decisions and takes actions autonomously.

Instead of programming a fixed control flow, we sometimes want LLM systems that can choose their own control flow to solve more complex problems:

- an LLM can decide between two potential routes
- an LLM can decide which of the many tools to call
- an LLM can decide whether the generated response is sufficient or if more work is needed
